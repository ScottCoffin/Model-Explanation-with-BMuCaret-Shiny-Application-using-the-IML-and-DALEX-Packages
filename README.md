# Shiny Application for Machine Learning Workflow

This Shiny application is a comprehensive tool designed for machine learning practitioners and data scientists to preprocess data, train machine learning models, validate their performance, and explain the models' predictions. Below is a detailed guide on what the app does and how to use it.

The original code author is Abderrahim Lyoubi-Idrissi. This version has been modified by Scott Coffin. See primary repo from fork for details.

## **What the App Does**

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualize the structure of the dataset.
- Identify missing values and correlations between variables.
- Compare the dataset before and after preprocessing.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- Automatically preprocesses the data using the `recipes` package.
- Handles missing values, normalizes numeric data, and removes highly correlated or sparse variables.

### 3. **Model Training and Validation**
- Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Networks, XGBoost, etc.) on the preprocessed data.
- Compare models based on performance metrics such as AUC (Area Under the Curve) and Accuracy.
- Provides detailed performance statistics for each model.

### 4. **Model Explanation**
- Offers global and local interpretation of machine learning models using advanced tools like `IML` and `DALEX`.
- Visualizes variable importance, partial dependence plots (PDP), accumulated local effects (ALE), interaction effects, Shapley values, and LIME explanations.
- Explains individual predictions and provides insights into how features influence the model's decisions.

## **How to Use the App**

### **Step 1: Launch the App**
- Run the app in RStudio or any R environment by executing the `shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)` command.
- The app will open in a web browser with a user-friendly interface.

### **Step 2: Explore the Data**
- Navigate to the **"Exploratory Data Analysis"** tab.
- Use the sub-tabs to:
  - View the structure of the dataset.
  - Check for missing values and visualize correlations.
  - Compare the dataset before and after preprocessing.

### **Step 3: Train Machine Learning Models**
- Go to the **"Fitting & Validation & Statistics"** tab.
- In the sidebar, select a model from the dropdown menu (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Network).
- Use the sub-tabs to:
  - View the model grid and training summary.
  - Compare the performance of all models using dot plots.
  - Examine the AUC and Accuracy of individual models on the training data.
  - Analyze tuning parameters and confusion matrices for specific models.

### **Step 4: Validate the Models**
- In the **"Model Validation & Statistics"** sub-tab:
  - View the AUC and Accuracy of individual models on the validation dataset.
  - Compare the performance of models on unseen data.
  - Analyze confusion matrices for specific models on the validation dataset.

### **Step 5: Explain the Models**
- Navigate to the **"Model Explanation"** tab.
- Select a model and a variable from the dropdown menus in the sidebar.
- Use the sub-tabs to:
  - View global interpretations, such as variable importance and feature interactions.
  - Explore local interpretations, such as Shapley values and LIME explanations for individual predictions.
  - Generate PDP and ICE plots to understand the effect of specific features on predictions.
  - Use surrogate models to approximate the behavior of complex models.

### **Step 6: Generate Reports**
- Use the **"Model Explanation"** tab to generate HTML reports summarizing the model's performance, variable importance, and other insights.
